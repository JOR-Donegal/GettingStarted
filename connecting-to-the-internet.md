## Physical Internet Connectivity

Mobile broadband has become ubiquitous and inexpensive. I live on a hill in one of the most rural, boggy places in the country. My backup link currently gives me very good 5G coverage and many separate providers. I use a high-gain mobile antenna to improve on that. This currently costs me <â‚¬15/month.
