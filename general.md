# General

The post-graduate courses in Cloud have been operational since 2015 and were intended to upskill technical graduates to mastery in a range of specific knowledge areas required by industry. The most recent evaluation and update of these courses and modules was in early 2022.

As platforms for teaching, we will focus on

1. VMWare (Workstation, ESXi)
2. Microsoft (Hyper-V)
3. Proxmox
4. Azure
5. AWS
6. Docker

These modules assume no previous experience and are intended for delivery on L9 programs. However, you should have a relevant under-graduate degree before commencing.

You are expected to achieve mastery over the duration of the module, do not underestimate the effort required.

We deliver material via a Virtual Learning Environment (VLE), currently Blackboard.

Where teaching resources are provided, they will be deleted or removed in August each year. If you need access to images or environments after 15th August, you need to discuss with your lecturer directly.
