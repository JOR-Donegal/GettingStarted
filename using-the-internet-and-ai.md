# Using the Internet and AI

Over the years, we have all grown to use internet searches for non-authoritative answers. With many things in technology, there are no authoritative answers, just many hours of trying all the ways that do not work before finding the one that does. Is this desirable or acceptable; no. Is it normal, sadly yes.

Part of being a scientist or engineer is learning how to discern the "truth", whatever that means!

Just about every professional I know will do an internet search when they are trying to figure out how to write an algorithm or configure a system. A good professional will look at the suggested answers for new ideas, etc. but will not believe the results. They certainly will not cut-and-paste the answers. But do we use the tools?&#x20;

Absolutely!

You are never to cut and paste from an Internet source or and AI application. Use them for ideas only.\
At the end of some modules, I will demonstrate how to do this in a way that should be acceptable. Until I have done so, DO NOT USE THESE TOOLS!!

Note that if you use an answer from an AI tool and another user uses the same tool, your answers will be indistinguishable and treated as probable plagiarism.
